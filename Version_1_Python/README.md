		--About the Program--

 'Card Fight' was created for the purpose of completing the 'Portfolio Project: Python Terminal Game' Module from CodeCademy: Computer Science Career path.

 Before this module there was another project that the course asked of me to create after finishing the lessons about Data stractures and Objects in Python3 to test my new skills and it was at that moment that I came with the idea of creating the particular program.

 At first I was planing to do sepereate projects but after seeing the scale of the project I realized that it was more than a simple "test" or a "summary project" and it was fiting for the requirements of the second project. 

 I progressed and decided to make it as my official portofolio project marking my completion of the first section of the Computer Science path.

 The project is a small terminal game for two players
 Both players pick a deck with 12 cards each and the are putting the one card against each other. 

 The Logic of this game is a simplefied version of the board game "Unmatched":
