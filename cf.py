#
# 'Card Fight' was created for the purpose of completing the 'Portfolio Project: Python Terminal Game' Module
# from CodeCademy: Computer Science Career path.
#
# Before this module there was another project that the course asked of me to create after finishing the
# lessons about Data stractures and Objects in Python3 to test my new skills and it was at that moment that
# I came with the idea of creating the particular program.
# At first I was planing to do sepereate projects but after seeing the scale of the project I realized that
# it was more than a simple "test" or a "summary project" and it was fiting for the requirements of second
# project. I progressed and decided to make it as my official portofolio project marking my completion of the
# first section of the Computer Science path.
#
# The project is a small terminal game for two players
# Both players pick a deck with 12 cards each and the are putting the one card against each other. 
# The Logic of this game is a simplefied version of the board game "Unmatched":
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmatched_(board_game) witch my hole project is based on
